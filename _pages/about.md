Hey :wave:! I'm currently a senior at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) majoring in Applied Mathematics. I am broadly interested in machine learning (interpretability +  robustness, few-shot learning) and Bayesian inference (variational inference and MCMC).

I do research under [Prof Itsik Pe'er](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/itsik-peer) reconstructing evolutionary trees of CRISPR-edited cells by learning hyperbolic embeddings. I also do research under [Prof David Knowles](https://davidaknowles.github.io/) on using variational inference for fine-mapping (predicting which genotypes cause a phenotype) with functional annotations.
