Hey :wave:! I'm currently a **Research Analyst** at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/)'s Center for Computational Mathematics working with [Bob Carpenter](https://bob-carpenter.github.io/).

My research interests broadly include
  - probablistic machine learning: generative models, diffusion
  - computational statistics: inference, sampling
  - LLMs: scaling laws

I graduated from [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) with a **B.A. in Applied Mathematics**.

I'm interested in broad array of topics outside of research: philosophy, fitness, evolutionary psychology, comedy, open source software etc.

I love when people reach out -- so please do!
