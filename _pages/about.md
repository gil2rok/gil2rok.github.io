Hey :wave:! I'm currently a **Research Analyst** at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/)'s Center for Computational Mathematics working with [Bob Carpenter](https://bob-carpenter.github.io/).

I am broadly interested in **deep learning** (interpretability, robustness, uncertainty quantification) and **Bayesian statistics** (variational inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo).

I graduated from [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) with a **B.A. in Applied Mathematics**, though lowkey I took mostly machine learning coursework.

At Columbia I did research with [Itsik Pe'er](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/itsik-peer) on reconstructing evolutionary trees of CRISPR-edited cells by learning hyperbolic embeddings.

I also did research with [David Knowles](https://davidaknowles.github.io/) on determing which genetic variants cause phenotypic traits by merging variational inference with gradient-based optimization.
