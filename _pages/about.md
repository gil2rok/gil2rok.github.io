Hey :wave:! I'm currently a guest researcher at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/)'s Center for Computational Mathematics.

I am broadly interested in machine learning (interpretability, robustness, few-shot learning) and Bayesian statistics (variational inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo). I am a big believer in hard work, living an intentional life, and self-learning.

I just graduated from [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) with a B.A. in Applied Mathematics. (I was two courses away from the CS major but took courses that piqued my interest instead of fulfilling major requirements.)

At Columbia I did research under [Prof Itsik Pe'er](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/itsik-peer) reconstructing evolutionary trees of CRISPR-edited cells by learning hyperbolic embeddings. I also did research under [Prof David Knowles](https://davidaknowles.github.io/) determing which genetic variants cause phenotypic traits (the fine mapping problem) by merging  variational inference with gradient-based optimization.
