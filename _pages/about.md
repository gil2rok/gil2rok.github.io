Hey :wave:! I'm currently a **Research Analyst** at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/)'s Center for Computational Mathematics working with [Bob Carpenter](https://bob-carpenter.github.io/).

My research is focused on (generative, efficient, and robust) **deep learning** as well as **Bayesian statistics** (variational inference + Markov chain Monte Carlo).

I like to hack on LLMs (honorable mention @ Cohere hackathon), open too many ArXiv tabs, and write open source code. I also like to train calisthenics frequently and salsa dance rarely.

I graduated from [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) with a **B.A. in Applied Mathematics**, though lowkey I mostly studied machine learning.

At Columbia I did research under [Itsik Pe'er](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/itsik-peer) on reconstructing evolutionary trees of CRISPR-edited cells with hyperbolic optimization. I also did research under [David Knowles](https://davidaknowles.github.io/) on determining which genetic variants cause phenotypic traits with variational inference.
