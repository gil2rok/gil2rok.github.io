Hey :wave:! I'm currently a **Research Analyst** at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/)'s Center for Computational Mathematics working with [Bob Carpenter](https://bob-carpenter.github.io/).

My research is focused on probablistic machine learning, generative models, and efficient/robust deep learning.

I graduated from [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) with a **B.A. in Applied Mathematics**, though lowkey I mostly studied machine learning.

I love when people reach out -- so please do!
