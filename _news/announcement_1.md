I am interning at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/)'s Center for Computational Mathematics working with [Chirag Modi](https://modichirag.github.io/) and [Bob Carpenter](https://bob-carpenter.github.io/) on Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for Bayesian inference.
